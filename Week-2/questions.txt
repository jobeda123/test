1.Fibonacci number
In mathematical terms, the sequence f(n) of fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
with seed values
f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 1
#Your task
You have to create the function fibonacci that receives n and returns f(n). You have to use recursion.


2. Sum of Nested List
Implement a function to calculate the sum of the numerical values in a nested list. For example :
sumNested([1, [2, [3, [4]]]]) => 10

3. Implement a reverse function, which takes in input n and reverses it. For instance, reverse(123) should return 321. You should do this without converting the inputted number into a string.

4. Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"])
// returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
